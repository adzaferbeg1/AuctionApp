# Auction App 

A web auction application project for [Atlantbh](https://www.atlantbh.com/) Internship developed through a three-month period from june to september of 2021. The idea was to create an efficient web application for online bidding and product exchange. Every month I was given several implementation tasks via [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Slack](https://app.slack.com/), and also presented my progress via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) platform.

## Tech stack

- **Spring Boot** - The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform
- **React** - Open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components
- **PostgreSQL** - A free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance

## Starting the app
**Inside** the directory, you can run several commands:

### **`yarn start`**
Starts the development server. You can open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser after the command is run, to make and view edits just refresh the page. <br/>
### **`yarn build`** 
Bundles the app into static files for production. The app is ready to be deployed. <br/> 
### **`yarn test`** 
Starts the test runner. <br/> 
### **`yarn eject`** 
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can't go back!
