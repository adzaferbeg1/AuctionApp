# Auction App 

A web auction application project for [Atlantbh](https://www.atlantbh.com/) Internship developed through a three-month period from june to september of 2021. The idea was to create an efficient web application for online bidding and product exchange. Every month I was given several implementation tasks via [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Slack](https://app.slack.com/), and also presented my progress via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) platform.

## Tech stack

- **Spring Boot** - The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform
- **React** - Open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components
- **PostgreSQL** - A free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance
